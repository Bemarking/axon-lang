//! §Fase 51.a — Proof-Carrying Code: the portable proof object.
//!
//! A [`ProofTerm`] is the serializable artifact a producer (the axon
//! compiler) emits alongside compiled code, certifying that a declared
//! property holds. A consumer runs the INDEPENDENT checker
//! ([`crate::pcc::checker`]) to verify it — WITHOUT trusting the
//! producer (D51.2). The term travels as JSON, the same delivery
//! surface as the SBOM / in-toto statements in [`crate::esk::attestation`],
//! but unlike those it is a *proof* the consumer re-checks, not an
//! attestation the consumer trusts.
//!
//! ## D51.1 — representation
//!
//! - [`PropertyClass`] — closed enum of property kinds. §51.a ships
//!   exactly [`PropertyClass::ComplianceCoverage`]; §51.b-e extend it.
//! - `artifact_digest` — SHA-256 hex of the canonical IR JSON the proof
//!   is ABOUT. Binds the proof to a specific artifact: a proof for
//!   program A cannot be replayed against program B (the checker
//!   recomputes the digest and rejects a mismatch).
//! - [`Witness`] — the property-specific derivation the checker
//!   re-verifies against the artifact.
//! - `axon_version` — producer version. Diagnostic only: the checker
//!   does NOT trust it (it re-derives the property regardless).
